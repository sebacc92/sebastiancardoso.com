# Optimizing the Web: Beyond Hydration

The modern web has evolved by leaps and bounds, and with it, the techniques and tools we use to build digital experiences. One of these techniques is hydration, a process that allows adding interactivity to HTML pages rendered on the server. However, as with any tool, it's essential to understand its advantages and disadvantages.

## What is Hydration?

Hydration is a solution to add interactivity to HTML pages rendered on the server. In web development, hydration turns a static HTML web page into a dynamic web page by attaching event handlers to the HTML elements. Although this definition focuses on attaching event handlers to static HTML, the real complexity and cost of hydration lie in knowing which event handlers we need and where they should be attached.

## The Problem with Hydration

Hydration is a term that has gained popularity in the world of web development, especially with the emergence of modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. However, despite its prevalence, hydration is not without challenges.

At its core, hydration can be considered an "overhead" because it involves work that could be avoided and still achieve the same result. But, what does this "overhead" truly mean? When talking about hydration, we refer to the process of taking a static HTML web page (usually generated by the server) and turning it into a dynamic web page on the client-side. This is achieved by attaching event handlers and reconstructing the application and framework state.

The real complication of hydration lies in two main aspects:

1. **Recovery of the Application State (APP_STATE):** When a page is rendered on the server, a specific application state is generated. This state can include user data, specific settings, and other details that make the page unique to the user. During hydration, this state must be reconstructed on the client so that the page functions as expected.

2. **Recovery of the Framework State (FRAMEWORK_STATE):** In addition to the application state, there's also an internal state that the framework or library uses to manage the page. This state includes details about which components are present, how they are interconnected, and how they should interact with each other.

The process of reconstructing these states involves eagerly executing the application code in the browser. This eager execution can be costly in terms of performance, especially on mobile devices with limited resources. Moreover, it's purely an overhead because, in essence, we are reconstructing information that the server had already gathered and sent to the client in the form of static HTML.

Additionally, this process can increase the time it takes for a page to become interactive for the user. While the page may appear visually loaded, interactivity can be delayed due to the time hydration takes.

## Resumability: An Overhead-Free Alternative

Resumability is a technique that seeks to eliminate the overhead of hydration. Instead of reconstructing the information that the server had already gathered, resumability focuses on transferring all the server's information to the client. This allows the client to reason about the application without having to eagerly download the application code. Only a user interaction forces the client to download the code to handle that specific interaction.

Qwik, a framework mentioned in the articles, is designed around resumability and achieves excellent startup performance. Instead of eagerly hydrating everything, Qwik allows for the lazy creation of event handlers, resulting in faster application startup times.

## Conclusion

While hydration has been a popular technique for adding interactivity to web pages, it's not without issues. Resumability emerges as a promising alternative that reduces overhead and improves performance. By understanding these techniques and their implications, we can make more informed decisions when building web experiences and offer end-users a faster and more efficient experience.
